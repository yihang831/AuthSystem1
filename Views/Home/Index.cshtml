        <h3>Introduction to Community Care Services</h3>
        <br />
        Your loved ones may fall sick and need medical help or receive care as they recover at home. They also need support with daily life, such as to eat and get dressed. There are community-based services available to support them and you, as their caregivers.
        <br />
        <br />
        Meanwhile, individuals who are in good health may want to take part in social activities.
